## Introduction
The beginning of the year saw limited work being done that's also why this devblog comes later than usual as I waited for things to accumulate. Without further ado, here's what's happened: A validation feature was added to the `Reports` class, code was removed due to low usage and the documentation received various updates.

Also the documentation received its first external pull request üëè

## Removing failed code
Even though I tried to live by [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) some code slipped in that was essentially useless. It seemed like a good idea at the time but ultimatively it turned out that it is not used or has little value overall. Additionally it made extending the `packageanalyzer` unnecessarily complicated. Time to remove it.

### Cause
Here's the interface for the `Provider`, the purpose of this class is to return the `package.json` for a given dependency:
```typescript
export interface IPackageJsonProvider {
    //load version specific data, loads latest version if no version is specified
    getPackageJson: (...args: PackageVersion) => Promise<IPackageJson>;
    getPackageJsons: (modules: PackageVersion[]) => AsyncIterableIterator<IPackageJson>;
}
```

`getPackageJson` allows you to query 1 dependency while `getPackageJsons` allows you to query an array of dependencies.

While the implementation of `getPackageJson` always differed depending on the use case (read from the fs, from a server etc.), the implementation of `getPackageJsons` turned out to be a copy and paste every time, namely just calling `getPackageJson` in an async loop:
```typescript
    async *getPackageJsons(modules: PackageVersion[]): AsyncIterableIterator<IPackageJson> {
        for (const [name, version] of modules) {
            yield this.getPackageJson(name, version);
        }
    }
```
This code needed to be pasted into every implementation of the `IPackageJsonProvider` interface, it never differed nor was there ever any need to have a different implementation. 

Luckily there was only one usage of `getPackageJsons` in the code so far and that was during the traversal of the dependency tree.

So I decided to remove this method from the interface and from every implementation and rewrite the tree traversal to use `getPackageJson` instead.

So now if you create a new `Provider` you only need to implement 1 method.

## Docs updates
The documentation also saw some updates:

### First pull request
Ph0tonic submitted the first ever PR to the documentation üëè

![first pr](./devblog5/pr.png "First PR")

thanks!

### New guide for the `Decorator`
A new guide was added that shows how to create a [`Decorator`](/docs/guides/creating_a_decorator).

### Screenshots
The [Cli Report documentation](/docs/cli/custom_report) now shows an actual screenshot of the command and not "todo screenshot" üòÖ

### Sections are now clickable
Sections are now clickable and will show a short introduction.

Previously you could only expand a section and then there was a dedicated Intro page explaining the section like shown here:

*Previous*
![old intro](./devblog5/intro_old.png "old Intro")

But now sections are clickable and what previously was shown in the Intro page has been moved to root:

*Now*
![better intro](./devblog5/intro_new.png "Better Intro")

This was done for all expandable sections, not just for `Cli`.

## Next Steps
As a general outlook, here's what is planned going forward this year:

### Monorepo?
As the project grows it might be time to try out a different project structure. The idea of the `packageanalyzer` is that it only provides the utility functions. Any other functionality should be provided by `Reports` or `Decorators`. For this reason it might make sense to look into monorepos to separate between the core and extra functionality.

### Multireports
Currently the `Report` class only supports 1 package. In order to compare 2 or more packages the `Report` class should support multiple packages.

The idea is to extend the `packageanalyzer` so that diff views of packages can created. E.g. compare 2 versions of the same package and see what changed (dependency changes, maintainer changes etc.).

### Override support
Recently NPM added support for [`overrides`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides). This allows you to replace a package in the dependency tree. It can for example be used to override a dependency with a known security issue or replacing an existing dependency with a fork etc.

Currently the `packageanalyzer` does not take the `overrides` config into account when traversing the dependency tree.

### Lockfile support
Likewise the `packageanalyzer` does not currently take lockfiles into account when traversing the dependency tree.
