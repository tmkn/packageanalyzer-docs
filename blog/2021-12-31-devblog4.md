## Introduction
Last devblog of the year ðŸ™ƒ

In this edition I'll talk about the work that has begun to make the packageanalyzer browser compatible. Changes to the `Provider` class and unit tests were fixed (once again) because they suddenly broke without having done any changes.

Lastly a recap what is missing for v1 in 2022.

:::info
 This devblog is about the `packageanalyzer` project.
 
 *A framework to introspect NodeJS packages.*

Please find a short introduction and the motivation for this project [here](/docs/intro).
:::

## Browser compatibility
The great thing about JavaScript is that it also runs in the browser. ðŸ™ƒ

Much of the functionality of the packageanalyzer is not dependent on NodeJS. So it should be possible to make it work in the browser.

Why? Because I have an idea for a new web project. There will be more info about it once I have something to show but to realize this idea I need (parts of) the packageanalyzer working in a browser first.

### The challenge
The main challenge was actually only making sure that no NodeJS specific libraries/code ends up in the web version.
Since NodeJS and browsers both understand JavaScript there was no additional complexity needed to make the browser understand the code.

You would just need to make sure there is no NodeJS specific code in the browser version. To do this I opted to use webpack.

### Webpack
I actually haven't used `webpack` in this project so far. I just used `TypeScript` to create the required files.

`Webpack` provides different bundling modes, you can tell it to create a NodeJS bundle or a web bundle. In the case of the web bundle it will error when it encounters NodeJS specific code.

Exactly what I needed!

However I will still use `TypeScript` to create the actual files, I will only use `webpack` to create a (fictitious) bundle in memory to check if there are NodeJS specific imports. If there are no such imports I let `TypeScript` then create the actual files.

### Setup
First I created a `web.index.ts` file which acts as the entry point for the web version by exporting the code that should be browser safe:
```typescript
//web.index.ts
export { Package } from "./package/package";
//...
```

Then I declared this entry point in the `package.json`:
```json
//package.json
{
    //...
    "exports": {
        "./web": "./build/src/index.web.js"
    }
    //...
}
```
So now the web version can be consumed in code via:
```javascript
import { Package } from "@tmkn/packageanalyzer/web";
```

To make `TypeScript` type definitions work, this also needed to be added to the `package.json`:
```json
//package.json
{
    //...
    "typesVersions": {
        "*": {
        "web": [ "./build/src/index.web.d.ts" ]
        }
    }
    //...
}
```

Then I used `webpack`'s API to check for those NodeJS specific imports:
```javascript
//webpack.web.config.js
const webpack = require("webpack");
const MemoryFileSystem = require("memory-fs");

const memoryFs = new MemoryFileSystem();
const compiler = webpack({
    entry: "./src/index.web.ts",
    mode: "development",
    target: "web",
    //...
});

compiler.outputFileSystem = memoryFs;

compiler.run((err, stats) => {
    //check for any errors here
});
```
The magic is `target: web` and `compiler.outputFileSystem = memoryFs;` which makes it compile in memory.

Now I can run `node ./webpack.web.config.js` and immediately get info whether the web version is using any NodeJS specific code.

All that's left to do is hook it up to the CI pipeline:
```json
//package.json
{
    "scripts": {
        "lint:web": "node ./webpack.web.config.js",
    }
}
```

```yml
#azure-pipelines.yml
- script: yarn lint:web
  displayName: 'Check web version for NodeJS code'
```

### Results
If there is NodeJS specific code in the web version the CI will fail:
![ci fail](./devblog4/nodejs_import.png "CI Web Check Fail")
Here in `visitor.ts` a NodeJS specific import was found: `fs`;

But if not everything is green and thus can be used in the browser.
![ci ok](./devblog4/azure_web_check.png "CI Web Check")
