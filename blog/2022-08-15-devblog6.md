### Algolia Integration
To help discoverability of the documentation I decided to add Algolia's DocSearch.
Up until now you couldn't search the documentation.

As the documentation is powered by **Docusaurus** it was super easy to add since it comes with Algolia support out of the box.

All that was needed was:
1. Sign up for [Algolia DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/apply) (It's free for Open Source Projects)
2. Add the provided API keys to the docusaurus conf:
```javascript title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // ...
  themeConfig: {
    // ...
    algolia: {
      appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
      apiKey: 'YOUR_SEARCH_API_KEY',
      indexName: 'YOUR_INDEX_NAME',
    },
  },
};

```

And with just that you've added search to your documentation:
![Algolia](./devblog6/algolia.png "Algolia")

The search is also responsive with light/dark theme support out of the box üëè
