Welcome to the very first devblog :tada:

If you don't know what this project is about, let me briefly introduce it:

> [A framework to introspect Node.js packages](/)

With that in mind, the content of todays devblog consists mostly of housekeeping, more specifically better naming for types and removing accumulated cruft.

<!--truncate-->

## Housekeeping surrounding the `Provider`

### Better naming

The purpose of the `Provider` is to return the `package.json` for a given module.
Since the beginning it had this interface:

```typescript
export interface IPackageVersionProvider extends Partial<INpmPackageProvider> {
  size: number;
  getPackageByVersion: (...args: PackageVersion) => Promise<INpmPackageVersion>;
  getPackagesByVersion: (
    modules: PackageVersion[]
  ) => AsyncIterableIterator<INpmPackageVersion>;
}
```

Given the explanation just before it's not immediately clear from the interface what its purpose is, worse there's also some cruft in there like `extends Partial<INpmPackageProvider>` and `size: number`.

If we just look at the core functionality we get this:

```typescript
export interface IPackageVersionProvider {
  getPackageByVersion: (...args: PackageVersion) => Promise<INpmPackageVersion>;
  getPackagesByVersion: (
    modules: PackageVersion[]
  ) => AsyncIterableIterator<INpmPackageVersion>;
}
```

Even though I'm accustomed to the code sometimes I have to pause and think which of those 2 interfaces gets me the `package.json`: `IPackageVersionProvider` or `INpmPackageProvider`. It's `IPackageVersionProvider`.

Also what's `INpmPackageVersion`? It's simply the `package.json` data.

To remove this ambiguity I opted to incorporate `package.json` more directly in the interface:

```typescript
export interface IPackageJsonProvider {
  getPackageJson: (...args: PackageVersion) => Promise<IPackageJson>;
  getPackageJsons: (
    modules: PackageVersion[]
  ) => AsyncIterableIterator<IPackageJson>;
}
```

Now I think its intent and purpose is much better communicated. Not that happy with `getPackageJsons` as I don't think it rolls easily of the tongue but it will have to do for now.

### Removal of `INpmPackageProvider` from the `Provider`

The purpose of the `INpmPackageProvider` interface was to get package metadata for a given package provided by NPM. It basically contains all the `package.json` for all versions plus the dates when it was released and other metadata. It looked like this:

```typescript
export interface INpmPackageProvider {
  getPackageInfo(
    name: string
  ): Promise<INpmPackage | IUnpublishedNpmPackage | undefined>;
}
```

The idea was to check for the implementation of this interface on the `Provider` and do some extra stuff, like displaying the release date. As said, the `Provider` returns a `package.json` this might come from an online source or from the local filesystem. But the data from `INpmPackageProvider` needs to be fetched online, this data will not become available via `npm install` on the filesystem. So it feels weird to attach `INpmPackageProvider` (which is online dependant) to the `Provider` interface which can work entirely offline.

Again, this was there since the very beginning but over time new API's emerged that made this specific case doable in a generic way namely via `Decorators`. `Decorators` are a way to attach additional data, which this NPM metadata file definitely is. Infact there's already a `ReleaseDecorator` which utilizes the `INpmPackageProvider` interface.

So I just deleted it from the now renamed `IPackageVersionProvider` and.... nothing happened. The code didn't rely on this interface being part of the `Provider` :raised_hands:

Lastly to better convey its intent, it was also renamed to `IPackageMetaDataProvider`:

```typescript
export interface IPackageMetaDataProvider {
  getPackageMetadata(
    name: string
  ): Promise<IPackageMetadata | IUnpublishedPackageMetadata | undefined>;
}
```

### Removal of the `size` attribute

As said the job of the `Provider` is to return the corresponding `package.json` for a given package.
Where it gets that data, offline or online, is subject to the implementation of the `Provider`.
The `size` attribute would return the count of `package.jsons` it could return.

But what do you return if you fetch it from online sources? Or more specifically, what's the purpose of having the `size` attribute? What can you do with it?

Short: **Nothing**. Or in this case, to use it in unit tests. Its actual and only usage was to verify that the implementation of the `FilesystemProvider` found all `package.json` on the filesystem during test execution. In case of the `OnlineProvider` it just returned the number of already downloaded `package.json`. How useful.

I like unit tests, I prefer to be safe than sorry but the `size` attribute is part of a public interface and ultimatively it's not useful. It's just a burden for anyone trying to get into the code.

Also I didn't want to make it `private` and then convince TypeScript in the unit tests that I know what I'm doing by accessing this `private` attribute publicly etc. It had to go, so ultimatively I deleted the whole thing.

Code coverage dropped by 0.04%:

![code coverage drop](./devblog1/codecoverage.JPG "Code Coverage Drop")

Which is unfortuante but given it's only 0.04% while in turn leaving the code base in a leaner state, I think it's the right tradeoff.

## Removal of the `start` argument

Since the ~~dawn of time~~ start of the project, the `visit` method looked liked this:

```typescript
visit: (callback: (dependency: T) => void, includeSelf: boolean, start: T) => void;
```

The `visit` method is used to traverse the dependency tree, it is part of the `Package` class and the `start` argument was meant as a way to only traverse a subtree, like this:

```typescript
const root: Package;
const someDependency: Package;

//only visit a subtree, everything under someDependency
//true includes someDependency itself
root.visit((dependency) => {}, true, someDependency);
```

But since the `Package` class is nested in nature and since you need a reference to your start `Package` anyway, you could just directly do:

```typescript
someDependency.visit((dependency) => {}, true);
```

Making the `start` argument useless.

It was a nice idea in the beginning but ultimatively it turned out to be not needed.
Worse, when I removed the argument from the interface, I expected some refactoring but TypeScript didn't complain, it wasn't used anywhere!
While I try not to fall victim to [YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)](http://wiki.c2.com/?YouArentGonnaNeedIt), I failed in this case as the only reason why it ended up in the code was because I thought I would need it, turns out I didn't.

## Index signature for `IPackageJson`

This was just a small convenience update. The `IPackageJson` interface resembles the data in a `package.json`.

```typescript
export interface IPackageJson {
  name: string;
  version: string;
  description: string;
  //....
}
```

But it was hardcoded to the values provided by the interface which is very inflexible.
Also it's impossible to statically type a dynamic data structure like `package.json` where you can add anything you want really.

It might work in simple cases like this:

```typescript
const react: IPackageJson = await provider.getPackageJson("react");

console.log(react.description);
```

but if you're trying to query something that is not defined in the interface, you'll get hit with the following error:

```typescript
const react: IPackageJson = await provider.getPackageJson("react");

//Property 'browserlist' does not exist on type 'IPackageJson'.
console.log(react.browserlist);
```

That's rather inflexible especially as there's no standard for a `package.json` and people are used to extend it however they want anyway.

So to make it possible to lookup custom keys I added an [Index Signature](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/type-system/index-signatures) to the interface:

```typescript
export interface IPackageJson {
  name: string;
  version: string;
  description: string;
  //....
  [key: string]: unknown;
}
```

If the key doesn't exist on the interface it will get the [`unknown`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-0.html#new-unknown-top-type) type rather than generating an error.

While the `IPackageJson` interface already defines some attributes and its types it's actually not guaranteed that this will be the case at runtime... it might actually be better (more typesafe) to also assign them `unknown` just to be on the safe side, but it worked so far. If this changes in the future it will definitely be material for a new #devblog.
