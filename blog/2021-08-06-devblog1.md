Welcome to the very first devblog :tada:

Lately, the work consisted mostly of housekeeping, more specifically better naming for types and removing cruft.

## Removal of the `start` argument
Since the dawn ~~of time~~ of the project, the `visit` method looked liked this:
```typescript
visit: (callback: (dependency: T) => void, includeSelf: boolean, start: T) => void;
```
The `visit` method is used to traverse the dependency tree, it is part of the `Package` class and the `start` argument was meant as a way to only traverse a subtree, like this:
```typescript
const root: Package;
const someDependency: Package;

//only visit a subtree, everything under someDependency
//true includes someDependency itself
root.visit(dependency => {}, true, someDependency);
```
But since the `Package` class is nested in nature and since you need a reference to you start `Package` anyway, you could just directly do:
```typescript
someDependency.visit(dependency => {}, true);
```
Making the `start` argument useless.

It was a nice idea in the beginning but ultimatively it turned out to be not needed.
Worse, when I removed the argument from the interface, I expected some refactoring but TypeScript didn't complain, it wasn't used anywhere!
While I try not fall victim to [YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)](http://wiki.c2.com/?YouArentGonnaNeedIt), I failed in this case as the only reason why it ended up in the code was because I thought I would need it, turns out I didn't.

That's all for this #devblog
