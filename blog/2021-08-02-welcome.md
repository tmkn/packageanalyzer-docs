Welcome to the packageanalyzer blog. The goal of this blog is to share happenings around the development of the packageanalyzer.

For now the idea is to elaborate more about the design decisions and code smells found in the source code.

That's the initial idea, we'll see what other topics will be interesting to blog about :)
